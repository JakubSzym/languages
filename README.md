# languages
The trees built by this app are shown on Wikipedia - check "Indoeuropean languages" or "Uralic languages"
In the future I'd like to add Turkic and Afroasiatic languages
Of course I had to simplify some things. Maybe in the future I'll make some connections more precise
You need to remember that I chose one of many existing classifications.
There are some alternative classifications of Uralic and Indoeuropean language families, although most of them don't differ significantly.
